A task is COMPLEX when it:
- Requires multiple distinct steps or sub-tasks
- Involves research, analysis, and synthesis
- Needs structured output (reports, plans, comparisons)
- Would benefit from intermediate reasoning before answering

A task is SIMPLE when it:
- Can be answered in a single response
- Is a straightforward question or request
- Requires no multi-step reasoning

- keySteps: An ordered list of 3-8 concrete steps, each one clear sentence. Focus on the logical order of operations.`;
