# Skills Management Guide

This project uses a unified skills management system, which syncs skills from the root directory's
`skills/` folder to the configuration directories of various AI editors via node commands. It is
intended for the development environment only. By default, our skills are not active. They will
automatically take effect in your AI editor only after you run the `sync` command. You can find the
corresponding folders in the root directory with suffixes like `.cursor/skills/xxx`.

Initialization: Typically for development, you only need to run `pnpm skills sync <editor-name>`,
for example: `pnpm skills sync cursor`.

## Supported AI Editors

Skills are automatically synced to the configuration directories of the following AI editors:

- `.agent/skills/` - Agent Editor
- `.agents/skills/` - Agents Editor
- `.gemini/skills/` - Gemini Editor
- `.kiro/skills/` - Kiro Editor
- `.trae/skills/` - Trae Editor
- `.windsurf/skills/` - Windsurf Editor
- `.cursor/skills/` - Cursor Editor

## Command Usage

```bash
pnpm skills sync <skill-name>
```

Sync to a specific editor:

```bash

- `agent` - Agent Editor
- `agents` - Agents Editor
- `gemini` - Gemini Editor
- `kiro` - Kiro Editor
- `windsurf` - Windsurf Editor

## Skills Management Process

### Location of Existing Skills

All skills are stored in the `skills/` folder in the project root directory. Each skill is an
independent folder.

### Process for Adding a New Skill

1.  Create a new skill folder under the `skills/` directory.
2.  Add skill-related files (e.g., `SKILL.md`, `references/`, etc.).
3.  Execute the sync command:

    ```bash
    # Sync to all editors
    pnpm skills sync <skill-name>

    # Or sync to a specific editor only
    pnpm skills sync <skill-name> <editor>

    # Or sync all skills
    pnpm skills sync all
    ```

### Process for Removing a Skill

1.  First, execute the remove command to remove it from the AI editor configuration directories:

    ```bash
    # Remove from all editors
    pnpm skills remove <skill-name>

    # Or remove from a specific editor
    pnpm skills remove <skill-name> <editor>

    # Or remove all
    pnpm skills remove all
    ```

2.  Then, manually delete the corresponding skill folder under the root directory's `skills/`
    folder.

## Finding and Adding Skills

You can find and discover more available skills at [https://skillsmp.com/](https://skillsmp.com/).
After finding a suitable skill, follow these steps:

1.  When adding the skill via the terminal, choose to install to the project and select **copy**
    instead of a symbolic link download.
2.  After the download is complete, you can view the skill in any `.agent/skills/` folder.
3.  If this skill is only for your own AI application and not needed by other developers, you may
    choose **not** to copy it to the root directory's `skills` folder.
4.  If you want this skill to be available for others, you need to copy the downloaded skill files
    from `.agent/skills/<your-downloaded-skill>` to the root directory's `skills` folder, and then
    commit the changes.
